## Quantum AI vs Classical AI in Optimization

Quantum AI leverages quantum mechanics (like superposition and entanglement) to evaluate many solutions simultaneously, solving complex optimization problems exponentially faster than classical AI.

### Industry Use

Sectors like **finance**, **pharmaceuticals**, and **logistics** can benefitâ€”e.g., quantum AI can quickly optimize delivery routes or simulate molecular interactions for drug discovery.
