## Bias in AI-Powered Personalized Medicine

AI models trained on unbalanced datasets (e.g., underrepresented ethnic groups) can result in biased treatment recommendations.

### Strategies:
- Use diverse, representative training data (e.g., TCGA across demographics).
- Implement fairness-aware learning algorithms.
- Continuous monitoring of model output for bias.
