## AI-Powered Climate Engineering (2030 Vision)

### Problem:
Global warming and extreme weather due to rising CO₂ levels.

### Solution:
AI models predict optimal geoengineering actions (e.g., stratospheric aerosol injection) based on climate data.

### Workflow:
- Inputs: Satellite CO₂ data, ocean temp, cloud density
- Model: Reinforcement learning for action-reward optimization
- Output: Control instructions for climate intervention devices

### Risks:
- Global inequality in climate impact
- Unpredictable side effects

### Benefits:
- Scalable response to climate crisis
- Data-driven environmental policy
