## Edge AI: Reducing Latency and Enhancing Privacy

**Edge AI** processes data locally on devices like smartphones or IoT sensors. This eliminates round-trip delays to the cloud, dramatically reducing latency. Additionally, sensitive data (like faces or voice) stays on the device, enhancing user privacy.

### Real-World Example

In **autonomous drones**, Edge AI enables real-time object detection and navigation without waiting for cloud responsesâ€”critical for safety and performance.
